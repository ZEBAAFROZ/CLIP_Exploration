# CLIP Model Implementation with Hugging Face Transformers

This repository contains a simple implementation of the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) model using Hugging Face Transformers. CLIP is a versatile model capable of understanding and connecting images and their textual descriptions in a shared embedding space. It can be used for tasks like zero-shot image classification, image generation from text, and more.
