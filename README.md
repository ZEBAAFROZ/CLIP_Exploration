Welcome to the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) implementation repository using Hugging Face Transformers. This project aims to provide an intuitive and versatile implementation of the CLIP model described in the paper "[Learning Transferable Visual Models From Natural Language Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00020)".

## What is CLIP?

CLIP, or Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining, is a groundbreaking neural network architecture introduced by OpenAI. It offers a unified framework for connecting images and their textual descriptions within a shared embedding space. This enables the model to understand and perform various tasks such as image classification, text-to-image retrieval, and more, using a single architecture.

## Key Features

- **Model Architecture**: Implement the CLIP architecture as described in the paper.
- **Transfer Learning**: Leverage pre-trained CLIP models from Hugging Face's model hub.
- **Zero-Shot Tasks**: Perform zero-shot image classification and text-to-image retrieval using CLIP.
- **Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tune the pre-trained CLIP model on custom datasets for specific tasks.
- **Versatile Usage**: Apply CLIP for various natural language understanding and computer vision tasks.

## Installation

1. You can install transformers using pip

```bash
pip install transformers
```

## Usage

1. Study the example notebooks provided to understand how to utilize CLIP for different tasks.
2. Modify and extend the code to suit your specific use cases and experiments.
